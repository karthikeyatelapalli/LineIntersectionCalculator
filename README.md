# Line Intersection Calculator

This Python program determines whether two lines intersect and calculates the intersection point if they do. The program uses the **Cramer's rule** to solve for the intersection point, taking four points as input from the user. The lines are represented in the form of linear equations: `ax + by = c`.

## **Features**
1. **Equation Generation**:
   - Generates equations of two lines based on the given points.
   - Outputs the equations in the format `ax + by = c`.

2. **Intersection Check**:
   - Determines if the two lines intersect based on the coefficients of their equations.

3. **Intersection Point Calculation**:
   - Uses **Cramer's rule** to calculate the intersection point when the lines intersect.

4. **User-Friendly Input**:
   - Allows the user to enter coordinates for four points.
   - Provides clear outputs, including the line equations and intersection points.
