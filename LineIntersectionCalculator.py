# Intersecting Points(with classes)
 
'''
Description: The LinearEquations class in this Python program is defined to determine the intersection_points of two lines given four points. If the lines do meet,
the intersection point is calculated using Cramer's rule using the coefficients of the lines in the form ax + by = c. The user is prompted to
enter four points, and the application displays the equation of the two lines and, if they cross, the point of intersection.
